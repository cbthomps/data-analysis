# data-analysis

For this project, I used Python's Beautiful Soup module to scrape review data from the website, Angry Metal Guy. I scraped it for album titles, band names, review authors, date, music genre, review score, DR score, and label name. I scraped the entire website and stored all of the data in a csv file.

Currently I am in the process of cleaning the data. I cleaned it manually in the Excel spreadsheet first, then I imported it into OpenRefine. With OpenRefine I split some of the columns, such as the first column that listed both the album title and band name all together. I will need to do some more manual cleaning of the file before it is ready to analyze.

My final plan is to use Python's Pandas module to create graphs to analyze many components of the website.
